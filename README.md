### About Me

<div align="justify">

I am a dedicated GIS and Remote Sensing specialist with a solid academic background in geography, environmental analysis, and satellite-based earth observation. My passion lies in harnessing spatial data and geospatial technologies to analyze and address real-world environmental challenges. I possess expertise in geospatial data processing, satellite imagery analysis, and spatial modeling, utilizing a wide range of tools and programming languages.

With practical experience in Google Earth Engine, ArcGIS, and QGIS, I focus on environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and spatial statistics. Additionally, I enjoy leveraging open-source Python libraries to automate workflows, perform raster and vector data analysis, and produce insightful geospatial visualizations.

I am committed to advancing data-driven storytelling to support sustainable decision-making and effective scientific communication.
